          Iâ€™m a software developer with a focus on building clean, efficient, and scalable applications.
        </p>
        <p>
         I enjoy working across backend systems and cloud-native technologies, 
         and Iâ€™m always exploring ways to create impactful digital experiences.

          .
        </p>
        <p>
        This portfolio is where I document my projects, share experiments, and occasionally <a

        href = {socialLinks.medium}
        >
        [write] 
        </a> about what Iâ€™ve been learning.
        </p>
        <p>
        Itâ€™s both a showcase of my work and a place to reflect on my journey as a developer.
        </p>
        <p>
        Iâ€™d love to connect with like-minded people, so donâ€™t hesitate to reach out.
